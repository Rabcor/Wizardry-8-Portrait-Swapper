# Usage
WIP

# Known issues

- MHUMM4 is broken
  - because it's structure is different from other STI files, no plans to fix it.
- Importing small portraits for RPCs is broken
  - Something is going wrong when repackaging it, might fix it someday but it doesn't really matter since you **never** see those pictures in-game anyways, they only appear in the main menu, during party creation I think.
